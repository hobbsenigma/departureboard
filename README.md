# departureboard
MBTA North Station departure board, based on MBTA v3 API

Uses ASP.NET Core MVC, Newtonsoft.JSON, JsonApiSerializer

Created for a coding challenge from Insurify (prompt below):

Use the MBTA's API (https://www.mbta.com/developers/v3-api) to build a website that shows a commuter rail departure board.  Just in case, here's what a real-life departure board at North Station looks like: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:North_Station_departure_board.JPG. We're not looking for any fancy styling, just something that can be quickly put together and works.
